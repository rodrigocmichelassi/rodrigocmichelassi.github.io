I'm a 8th period computer science undergraduate student at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IME-USP) and Machine Learning researcher, advised by [Prof. Nina S.T. Hirata](https://www.ime.usp.br/~nina/) and funded by [MCTI/PPI Softex](https://sites.usp.br/synestechai/).

For now, I am focusing on my undergraduate research project, in which I am exploring deep learning techniques to assess image quality on retinal images, based on its visual features. This project is fundamental, ensuring the reliable use of deep learning in medical images for other tasks, such as automating the diagnosis process. 

I have also worked a summer as a software engineer intern at BTG Pactual, the biggest investment bank in Latin America, in which I have developed a system to centralize the bank's internal messages at a PostgreSQL database, generating operational optimization and avoid the need of a 11-minute deploy for each new/edited message.

Not only that, but I have also been contributing to open source projects, with a special focus on the Gnome project, which hopefully I will have some more contributions from now on.

This blog's idea is to share checkpoints on personal projects and development. You can [contact me on my social media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-michelassi/).
