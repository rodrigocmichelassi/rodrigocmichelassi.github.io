I'm a 7th period computer science undergraduate student at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IME-USP). I have started this blog due to a open source development class, which encouraged us to share checkpoints on our development path, and decided adopt this idea to create checkpoints on my personal projects.

For now, I am focusing on my undergraduate research project, in which I am exploring deep learning techniques to assess image quality on retinal images, based on its visual features. This project is important due to the need of avoiding misclassification on retinal diseases, in special diabetic retinopathy.

I have also been contributing to open source projects, and trying to start contributing more to the GNOME project, hopefully I will have some more contributions from now on.

This blog's idea is to share checkpoints on development, not making special posts for each project after its finished, and will keep going that way. You can [contact me on my social media](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-michelassi/).
